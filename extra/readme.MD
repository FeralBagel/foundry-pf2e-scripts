# Extra Stuff

This folder is just for bizarre and extra stuff that doesn't have any particular application outside of whatever I intended.

## Supported Versions

These scripts were written for FoundryVTT 0.6.6 with PF2E version 1.10.10.1973.

## Usage

This folder contains a single file: [m_toggleSkinSuit.js](./m_toggleSkinSuit.js). It is a macro for toggling the image/appearance of a monster token. It was built for the Vermlek (Worm Demon) in the first module of the Extinction Curse Adventure Path.

In short, it works two ways:
1. If the Worm Demon token "looks" like the Prototype, it changes its appearance, adds the +3 circumstance AC bonus, and changes its name.
2. If the Worm Demon token is in the "skin suit" mode, it changes it back to look like the prototype, removes the circumstance AC bonus, and plays a sound effect.
